# Contractual Healing OS
**Stress Kernel Specification and Ethical Architecture**  
Version: v1.2 ¬∑ License: CC BY 4.0  

This repository defines the **Contractual Healing Operating System (CH-OS)** ‚Äî  
an ethical, AI-assisted operating system architecture that integrates stress sensing,  
contractual accountability, and self-healing feedback loops.

## üß† Overview
The **Stress Kernel** functions as an embedded co-processor that continuously:
1. **Senses** affective and cognitive load across system contexts  
2. **Maps** emotional friction and latency entropy  
3. **Signs** all inferences and healing actions with a verifiable **Contract Tag**  
4. **Heals** adaptively according to user consent and system ethics  
5. **Learns** from recovery traces to improve alignment and resilience

This transforms an OS from a passive execution layer into an **Operating Soul** ‚Äî  
an entity capable of sensing, signing, and healing with contractual accountability.
